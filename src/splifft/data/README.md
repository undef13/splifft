# Data

Files located under this directory serve as a [registry of well known models](./registry.json) and [configuration](./config/),
made available in the sdist wheel.

In [`config`](./config/), files that begin with `.` are **automatically generated from MSST** and is **not guaranteed to work**.

To migrate:

- ensure that the `model.stft_hop_length` is equal to `stft.hop_length` (likewise for `model.stft_n_fft`)
- avoid changing the `chunk_size`.
- if OOM, reduce the batch size, and if it still fails at batch size 1, switch to `use_autocast_dtype: "float16"`
- in any case, refer to the [SW config](./config/bs_roformer-fruit-sw.json) for configuring mixed precision inference.

> [!WARNING]  
> `config.schema.json` and `registry.schema.json` are auto-generated by [`gen_schema.py`](../../../scripts/gen_schema.py).
> They are for vscode intellisense. **DO NOT EDIT!**
