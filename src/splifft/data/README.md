# Data

Files located under this directory serve as a [registry of well known models](./registry.json) and [configuration](./config/),
made available in the sdist wheel.

In [`config`](./config/), files that begin with `.` are **automatically generated from MSST** and is **not guaranteed to work**.

> [!WARNING]  
> `config.schema.json` and `registry.schema.json` are auto-generated by [`gen_schema.py`](../../../scripts/gen_schema.py).
> They are for vscode intellisense. **DO NOT EDIT!**
